Deliverable 2: Build 2

Report:

Our intially build was focused on writing code for car physics and making car track. We achieved a basic code structure and undertanding 
of developing the same. And were able to pick of earlier build and enhance it better with help of Unity assets. This Build focused on AI 
and smoothing car models.

Objectives: 
1.Car models for AI and User.
We can attach car contrller scripts on any car models. Hence, this encouraged us to use car models from 
Asset store to enhance the art for 3D models

2.Racing Track with adventurous slides
The entire track will have slides and jump ramps to increase a fun element, and allow players to perform stunts.

3.User car Physics modifications- Smooth Maneuvering of cars 
Taking reference from Car Controller Script from Standard Assets allows accurate car physics simulation.

4. Car Physics Audio.
The car audio script will interpolate between the audio files baseed on threshold.
Citation: Audio clips Standard Assets

5.  Turret.
A missile shooting gun on top of the jeep to shoot opponent cars.
The turret rotates across Y axis using Transform.LookAt funtion to point towards opponents cars for shooting.
Would be used for shooting mechanism in the future builds.

6. Min â€“Map Camera.
Small Navigation map for estimating probable collectable along the path of race track.
Using Second top down camera with depth cues.

7. Car AI
Path Following Scripts using Waypoints.
This is still working in a crude way, may try navmesh navigation to improve smoothness.
